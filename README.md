### Challanges Faced

```
    1. Faced challanges in implementing 'react-pdf' and understood the concept of disabling the 'ssr' by importing the component dynamically and resolved those issue.
    2. As I am new to this Tech stack, got bit confused with the routing implementation and come up with solution for each hurdles with the help of documentation.
```
